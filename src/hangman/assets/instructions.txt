Welcome to Hangman!

Hangman is a word guessing game where you will be hanged
(and therefore lose) if you guess incorrectly more than
6 times. There will be no characters other than ASCII
letters, and inputs are case-insensitive.

There are four levels:

 - [E] Easy (22.5k words)      - [M] Medium (74.5k words)
 - [H] Hard (168k words)       - [U] Unix (205k words)

A correct guess merits you 2 point each letter, while an
incorrect guess costs you 1 points, multiplied by the
coefficient of the level: Easy 1, Medium 2, Hard 3, Unix 4.

The game is round-based. You will be asked to continue after
each round. To exit the game at any time, press Ctrl + C.
